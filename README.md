# Recon-Automation-Script
This is a script which I made using bash, I am trying to update it and advance it as much as I can.
Just add your discord token with the notify command at the end of the line for which you want to get notified

[script line] | notify

the token can be added to the norify configuration file
Notify is free to use from project discovery, here you can get some more information

## Usage

Just use ./script.h <domain name eg. yahoo.com>
